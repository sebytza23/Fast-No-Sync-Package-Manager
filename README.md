# FNSPM (Fast No Sync Package Manager)

A unified command-line interface for managing packages across multiple package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun, and deno) with macOS optimization for iCloud sync and automatic package manager detection.

## Features

- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects the project's package manager based on lock files
- **Native Flags**: Use native flags for each package manager
- **Node Modules Management**: Automatically creates symlinks for better system performance
- **Supported Platforms**: macOS, Windows, Linux

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g fnspm
```

## Initialization
#### Initialize FNSPM in your project:

> **Info**: If you skip the initialization step, FNSPM will use the **[default configuration](#default-configuration-file)**. However, it's recommended to run the initialization command to customize the setup according to your needs.

```bash
fnspm initialize [options]
```

### Initilization Options (all optional):

- `--default, -d`: Use default configuration
- `--pm`: Set default package manager (npm|yarn|pnpm|bun|deno)
- `--detection`: Set detection mode (auto|default|npm|yarn|pnpm|bun|deno)
- `--symlink`: Enable symlink creation
- `--no-symlink`: Disable symlink creation
- `--sync-folder`: Set nosync folder name
- `--no-sync-folder`: Disable nosync folder creation
- `--add-to-gitignore`: Add nosync folder to .gitignore
- `--no-add-to-gitignore`: Disable adding nosync folder to .gitignore
- `--verbose`: Enable verbose logging
- `--no-verbose`: Disable verbose logging

## Configuration
The configuration file is located in the root of the project and is named `fnspm.config.{cjs, mjs, js}`.
- `CommonJS` and `ES6` are supported.
- CommonJS extension is `.cjs`
- ES6 extension is `.mjs`
- JavaScript extension is `.js`
- Extension is automatically detected on initialization based on the `package.json` file.

### Default configuration file

```js
/** @type {import('fnspm').Config} */
const config = {
    "packageManager": {
        "default": "npm",
        "detection": "auto",
    },
    "symlink": {
        "enabled": true,
        "addToGitIgnore": true,
        "nosyncName": "node_modules.nosync",
    },
    "debug": {
        "verbose": false,
    },
};

// CommonJS and JS
module.exports = config;

// ES6
export default config;
```

## Usage

Basic syntax:
```bash
fnspm [command] [packages] [flags]
```

### Commands and Flags

- All native commands and Flags are supported

### Global Flags

- `--debug`: Show runned commands
- `--pm <manager>`: Use specified package manager
> **Note**: The `--pm` flag allows you to temporarily use a specific package manager for the current command only. This does not modify your configuration file - the default package manager specified in `fnspm.config.{cjs, mjs, js}` will still be used for subsequent commands. For example:
> ```bash
> # This command uses npm just for this installation
> fnspm --pm npm install lodash
> 
> # Future commands will still use your default package manager
> fnspm install express # Uses detection from config (auto|default|npm|yarn|pnpm|bun|deno)
> ```
### Examples

```bash
# Install lodash using npm with dev flag
fnspm --pm npm install lodash -d

# Install moment globally using yarn
fnspm --pm yarn install moment -g

# Install multiple packages with pnpm
fnspm --pm pnpm install -d lodash moment

# Uninstall a package using bun
fnspm --pm bun uninstall moment

# Update packages using deno
fnspm --pm deno update

# List installed packages using npm
fnspm --pm npm list

# Install all packages (auto-detected)
fnspm install â†’ npm/yarn/pnpm/bun/deno install
```

### Auto-Detection

If no package manager is specified, FNSPM will detect it based on lock files:
- `package-lock.json` â†’ npm
- `yarn.lock` â†’ yarn
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` â†’ pnpm
- `bun.(lockb|lock)` â†’ bun
- `deno.lock` â†’ deno

## Features in Detail

### Node Modules Management
- Automatically converts `node_modules` to `node_modules.nosync`
- Creates symlinks for better system performance
- Prevents unnecessary syncing
> **Note**: The synchronization process uses a special folder to prevent your node modules from being synced to cloud storage:
> - This folder is defined by the `nosyncName` setting in your configuration file
> - For iCloud users, it defaults to `node_modules.nosync`
> - You can customize this name to work with other cloud providers
> - This prevents large dependency folders from:
>   - Taking up cloud storage space
>   - Using unnecessary bandwidth
>   - Slowing down your cloud sync
> 
> Your project will continue to work normally while keeping your cloud storage efficient.
